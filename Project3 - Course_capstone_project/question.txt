Analyze the attached dataset. The dataset includes information about electric vehicle purchases in the state of Washington. The variables and columns in the dataset are generally clear and understandable, but please ask questions if you do not understand the meaning of a variable or column. Fully analyze the dataset using approaches and tools covered thus far in the course. You should not use every approach, method, etc. Instead, determine the best approach to derive business insights, based on the data and variables present in the dataset. Generate important and insightful plots and charts, but do not include unnecessary ones. You can comment-out any plotting code that you did not use or that was not insightful. You will be penalized for trying to do everything and throwing everything into your project or report. One way to maintain focus is to determine your objectives or even hypotheses before you begin your main analysis. Remember, you should always include descriptive statistics regardless of other approaches you utilize.
